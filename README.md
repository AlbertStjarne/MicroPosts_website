# MicroPosts website - Post what's on your mind

A website where you can post what's on your mind. You post a title and text. Once submitted the posts can be edited or deleted.

It is a full CRUD application built with pure vanilla JavaScript.

It includes the easyHTTP library from the earlier project.

To mimic a REST API JSON Server has been used holding a json file with the added posts.
